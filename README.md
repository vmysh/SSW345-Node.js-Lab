I finished this lab without much difficulty, and I got everything to work as it should.

Some things I got stuck on:

1. Kept typing https instead of http in the beginning
2. Didn't know that I could open another Command Prompt window to run commands while the server is running

I now have a basic understanding of the 4 HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and how to create a simple API. It is still a lot of new information to grasp, so I definitely need more practice before I will feel confident in creating an API without step-by-step instructions.
